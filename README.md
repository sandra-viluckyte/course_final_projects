# Projects completed as part of the Data Analytics course at Vilnius Coding School

## Description
Here you'll find my Python and Power BI projects, completed as part of my Data Analytics course. I've included the datasets I used alongside the project files. Although the course featured a SQL test, I opted to create a separate, more analytical project to better showcase my SQL skills beyond a simple Q&A format.

## Structure
- **Power_BI_Project**: folder contains a pdf file of how the project looks visually and a txt file with URLs to access the dataset and Power BI file. Due to large sizes of both files I could not upload them here.
- **Final_Python_Project**: folder contains ipynb and py project files, data dictionary and the datased used.

## How to check?
- **Python and pdf files can be checked here by clicking on them**
- **CSV files can be downloaded and opened with Microsoft Excel or a similar program**
- **You will need to download Power BI file by clicking on the URL found in txt file**

## Datasets
All of the datasets were downloaded from Kaggle.
- [Flight Satisfaction Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khaledxbenali/airline-passenger-satisfaction)
- [Beverage Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ambikaprasadrath/synthetic-beverage-sales-data)
