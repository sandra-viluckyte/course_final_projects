# Projects completed as part of the Data Analytics course at Vilnius Coding School

## Description
Here you'll find my Python and Power BI projects, completed as part of my Data Analytics course. I've included the datasets I used alongside the project files. Although the course featured a SQL test, I opted to create a separate, more analytical project to better showcase my SQL skills beyond a simple Q&A format.
